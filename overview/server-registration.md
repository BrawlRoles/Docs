# Server Registration

##Why do I have to register my Server?

We, the Brawl Roles Staff, require you to register the Server you want to use Brawl Roles in. And all that is only because of the following reasons.

* We have some hard times with hosting the bot, so we want to be able to regulate the amount of servers using the bot.

* Like that, we can also have an overview from all the Servers, Brawl Roles is in.

##How do I register my Server?

1. Join our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/ucScGNU)

2. Copy the Server ID of your Server. If you need help finding your Server ID, see more on the [official Discord Support page](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-)

3. If you have the Server ID, visit the channel [#register-your-server](https://discord.com/channels/632935044935188510/723308769290879137) and enter the command ``.register [your-Server-ID]``.

4. Staff will then check your application and register your Server.

5. You can see the progress of your registration in the channel [#server-registered](https://discord.com/channels/632935044935188510/719274112773652490)

{% hint style="info" %}
Server registrations can take up to 12 hours, so please just be patient.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
A user account can only register on server, if you want to register a 2nd server, please use an alternative account. Also leaving our support server, will result in de-registration of your server, because we cannot inform you about the news anymore.{% endhint %}
