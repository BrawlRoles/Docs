We recommend that you have high permission on the server (Administrator). If you don't have these permissions, you can't use many commands.   
{% endhint %}

If you haven't invited the bot already, you can invite him [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=686123976296103945&scope=bot&permissions=2146954495)

1. Move the bot's role as high as possible. Make sure that he's higher than the role he should give. 

2. If you want to change the language you can do this with [here](../commands/administration/setlanguage.md)

3. set up the [verification-log](../commands/administration/verificationlog.md)

4. When the log is set up correctly, you're now able to enable the [verification](../commands/administration/verification.md)

5. Now you can add [roles](../commands/administration/role.md) and [club roles](../commands/administration/club.md)
