We recommend that you have high permission on the server (Administrator). If you don't have these permissions, you can't use many commands.   
{% endhint %}

If you haven't invited the bot yet, you can invite it [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=686123976296103945&scope=bot&permissions=2146954495)

After that, you have to join our [support server](https://discord.gg/ucScGNU) to register your Server. See more about that [here](../overview/server-registration)

1. Move the bot's role position as high as possible. Make sure that it's highest role is higher than the roles he hands out.

2. If you'd like to change the language you can do this with the command [setlanguage](../commands/administration/setlanguage.md)

3. To start, set up the [verification-log](../commands/administration/verificationlog.md)

4. If the log is set up correctly, you're now able to enable the [verification](../commands/administration/verification.md). But have a look at the command first, it might be a little complicated.

5. Now you can add [roles](../commands/administration/role.md) and [club roles](../commands/administration/club.md) and ask in the Support channels.
