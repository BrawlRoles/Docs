##How to actually use it


We have the Discord user `@Knirpsii` whose in-game tag is `#YU9G98V8`. He already saved his user tag with the `verify` command. He made progress and wants some new Roles. He can run the following command and gets new roles. Wrong stat roles will be removed.
```
-update
```

In the second case, we have the Discord user `@Knirpsii` whose in-game tag is `#YU9G98V8`. He already saved his user tag with the `verify` command. He made progress but doesn't want to update his user roles. An administrator can run the following command.
```
-update @Knirpsii
```
